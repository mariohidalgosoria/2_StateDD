Programs for simulating a two state diffusing diffusivity model

### A particle follows a pure diffusion process, changing
intermittently between two different diffusion coefficients
D_{+}>D_{-}. Each diffusion coefficient is followed during a
random waiting time with the same distribution but with different
parameters. The process starts from equilibrium initial conditions. 


1) Uniform distributed waiting times.
-> The C program MXUni.c generates trajectories of a two state
system with D_{+}=10 and D_{-}=0. Uniform distributed waiting times,
for the state D_{+} the waiting times have uniform distribution
between zero and five. For the state D_{-} the waiting times have
a uniform distribution between zero and ten. The program gives as
an output the file 'Xpap0bp5am0bm10T1.dat' with the final positions.
And the file 'Ppap0bp5am0bm10T1.dat' with the fraction occupation times.

->Compile & Run as:
gcc -o MXUni MXUni.c -lm
./MXUni


2) Gamma distributed waiting times.
-> The C program MXGamma.c generates trajectories of a two state
system with D_{+}=10 and D_{-}=0. Gamma distributed waiting times,
for the state D_{+} the waiting times have Gamma distribution with
parameters Gamma(0.5,8). For the state D_{-} the waiting times have
a gamma distribution with parameters Gamma(0.5,12). The program gives as
an output the file 'Xpap4am6T30.dat' with the final positions.
And the file 'Ppap4am6T30.dat' with the fraction occupation times.

->Compile & Run as:
gcc -o MXGamma MXGamma.c -lm
./MXGamma
